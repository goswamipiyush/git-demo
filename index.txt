hello to everyone on the git course

Jofra Archer is the clear and undisputed MVP of IPL 2020, according to ESPNcricinfo's Smart Stats. Archer's conventional numbers speak for themselves: 20 wickets at 18.25, conceding 6.55 runs per over. The economy rate was the best among the 40 seamers who bowled at least 15 overs in the tournament. Archer's powerplay economy rate of 4.34 was among the best by any bowler in any T20 tournament. As if that wasn't enough, he also exceeded expectations with the bat, scoring at a strike rate of 179 and hitting ten sixes - fourth-highest for the Rajasthan Royals - off the 63 balls he faced.
